**Building data warehouse on Snowflake**

The Snowflake cloud data warehouse enables data storage and analytics on a dynamic, highly scalable platform in the cloud.
BryteFlow can help you deploy your real-time Snowflake  Data Warehouse with complete automation and without coding. BryteFlow uses enterprise log-based change data capture on legacy databases like SAP HANA, Oracle, SQL Server, PostgreSQL and MySQL, and from applications like SAP ECC, S/4 HANA, Salesforce etc. to move data from the sources to the Snowflake data warehouse in real-time.
