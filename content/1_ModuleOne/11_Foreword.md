## Snowflake Data Warehouse and BryteFlow<!-- MODIFY THIS SUBHEADING -->

The Snowflake Data Warehouse or Snowflake as it is popularly known, is a cloud data warehouse. The Snowflake cloud data warehouse enables data storage and analytics on a dynamic, highly scalable platform in the cloud.  

BryteFlow can help you deploy your real-time Snowflake Data Warehouse on AWS fast and without coding. BryteFlow uses enterprise log-based change data capture on legacy databases like Oracle, SQL Server, SAP, PostgreSQL and MySQL, and from applications like Salesforce etc. to move data from the sources to the Snowflake data warehouse in real-time. It maintains a replica of the source structures in Snowflake and merges the initial and delta loads automatically with SCD type 2 history if required.
