## Why choose Snowflake ?<!-- MODIFY THIS SUBHEADING -->
Snowflake the cloud data warehouse is based on SQL and is easy to use.  

**Data can be queried with standard SQL query language**
The Snowflake database was designed as a fully functioning SQL database. The Snowflake SQL database is a columnar-stored relational database that works with Excel, Tableau and other common software. Snowflake data can be queried with standard SQL query language. Data analysts are extremely familiar with SQL and can get started on analytics fast.  

**Snowflake is a highly automated SaaS offering**
Your Snowflake SQL database will not require expensive hardware or software to be installed or configured. The custom-built Snowflake big data infrastructure is fully managed and maintained by Snowflake.  
**The Snowflake data warehouse is highly dynamic and scalable**
You don’t need to worry about the size of your Snowflake database. The Snowflake data warehouse is highly dynamic and scalable. Snowflake’s big data architecture is shared and multi-cluster with each cluster accessing data and running independently without conflict. This is ideal for running large queries and operations simultaneously.  

**Snowflake data is extremely secure**
The Snowflake data warehouse automatically encrypts all data. Multi-factor authentication and granular access control is reassuring too. The Snowflake cloud data warehouse uses third party certification and validation to make sure security standards are met. Access control auditing is available for everything including data objects and actions within your Snowflake database.
