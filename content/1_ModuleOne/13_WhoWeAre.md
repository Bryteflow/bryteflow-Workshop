## BryteFlow Ingest- Replicate data in real-time <!-- MODIFY THIS SUBHEADING -->
BryteFlow can help you deploy your real-time Snowflake  Data Warehouse on AWS platform fast and without coding.  
BryteFlow uses enterprise log-based change data capture on legacy databases like Oracle, SQL Server, SAP, PostgreSQL and MySQL, and from applications like Salesforce etc. to move data from the sources to the Snowflake data warehouse in real-time. It maintains a replica of the source structures in Snowflake and merges the initial and delta loads automatically with SCD type 2 history if required.
